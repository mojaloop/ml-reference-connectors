# Core Connector Lib 
The core connector library contains all shared functionality for all core connectors. It significantly decreases the amount of effort needed to develop a core connector and it improves the developer experience.

The goal for connector development is that a developer will only need to implement an interface and provide configuration for connecting to a DFSP or an FXP.
