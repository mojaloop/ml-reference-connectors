# Airtel Core Connector 

# Introdution
This core connector facilitates communication between the Airtel Zambia mobile money api and the Mojaloop Connector. It processes incoming requests from Airtel's customer facing platform and routes them to mojaloop through the mojaloop connector. It was created based on the [Core Connector Template](../core-connector-template/). 

# Integration Accounts
These are accounts that are used to facilitate incoming and outgoing payments in the airtel mobile money platform.
- Disbursements Account: This account is a funded account that is used to support incoming payments. When a request to credit a customer account is received by the connector, checks are performed by the connector and eventually funds will be credited to the customer's account from this account. 
- Collections Account: This is an account that is used to support outgoing payments. When a request to send funds out of airtel is received, this account serves as the holding place for funds that are owed to the scheme.

At the end of the day, these are the accounts used to support the settlement process and to make sure everyday DFSP is paid what they are owed.
